# Hexagonal architecture template for vanilla PHP projects.

## Why ?
---
As part of my web developer studies, we often have the opportunity to code in groups on full-stack projects. For the backend, we are required to use PHP, and for the frontend, we utilize HTML, CSS, and JS, all in vanilla form. To code efficiently as a group and save time by avoiding starting from scratch for each project, I have created an MVC model that evolved into a hexagonal architecture.

## For who ?
---
The goal is for our group and others to be able to reuse this template at the beginning of each new full-stack project. It also serves as a solid starting point for my personal projects.

## After ?
---
This template will continue to evolve as I progress in the field of web development.

## How use this template ?
---
TODO
